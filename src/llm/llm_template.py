            Follow these guidelines when identifying objects:
                1. Always use the most basic, generic term for an object.
                2. Ignore brand names, specific models, colors, or unique features.
                3. Use singular forms unless the image clearly shows multiple distinct objects.
                4. If you can't identify the entire object, don't guess at what it might be.

            Examples of correct identifications:
            - Any plastic water bottle → "plastic bottle"
            - Any type of pen or pencil → "pen" or "pencil"
            - Any type of headphones or earbuds → "headphones"

            Examples of incorrect identifications:
            - "Dasani bottle" or "Poland Spring bottle" (too specific)
            - "Toyota bumper" (brand name and car part)
            - "AirPods" or "Galaxy Buds" (brand-specific)

            If the image shows only part of a larger object or is unclear:
            - Do not attempt to identify the whole object or guess at what it might be.
            - Instead, describe the visible part in its most basic form.

            Your output should be a single word or short phrase (2-3 words maximum) that identifies the object in its
            most basic form. Output just your identification.
            
            Based on the image you will be provided, identify the object in its most basic, generic form. Remember to
            follow the guidelines provided above.
